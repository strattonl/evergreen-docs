# Creating holdings templates
Evergreen version 3.8

There are two ways to create holdings templates in Evergreen v.3.8: using the Holdings Editor integrated template editor and the Local Administration > Holdings Template Editor.

## Holdings Editor integrated holdings template editor
This holdings editor interface does not support creating templates that include Item Alerts or Item Notes. Alerts and Notes must be added when item records are being created.

1. From catalog search, retrieve a title record
1. Click Add Holdings  or right click on an existing item record and select Edit Items
1. Click Item Attributes tab
	- The Templates bar will display either the name of the first existing template in alphabetical order or the most recently used template, and all template actions: Apply, Save, Import, Export and Delete Template. These actions work on the templates only, not the item.  
1. In the Item Attributes fields, select and Apply values to add to the new template
1. Apply all required values and stat cats
1. In the Templates bar, overwrite the template name and replace the name of the new template 
1. Click Save
1. To verify that the template had been created
1. Click the browser refresh button; at the Reload Site? Confirmation, click Reload (no items are being created or edited)
1, Expand the list of Templates and find the new template  

**NOTES:**
- When a field value is selected, it MUST ASLO be applied to be saved to the template.
- The field turns green when it has been applied.
- Fields that are not applied/green will not be saved in the template.
- Template fields without applied values will not override existing fields in existing items records or default values in new records.
- A red asterisk indicates that the fields have not been saved to the item.
